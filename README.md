# injecthtml
A method of injecting HTML and CSS into a DOM

## Description
We want to inject new HTML elements into our DOM by sing javascript and fetching content from another part of the server.

The Javascript file will fetch data from the web server and turn that into text and inject this as the innerHTML of a specified element. It also fetches CSS text and adds that as a new style node to the HEAD element.

The injected HTML uses its own CSS for design, placement and some CSS animation. It also presents a link that can be clicked and opens oin a new window.
